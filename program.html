            <span class="h1"> Endurance workouts</span>
            <p>Endurance workouts are designed to raise your heart rate and get your blood pumping faster. Endurance workouts<br>
                are essentially cardiovascular workouts, working your body out aerobically. The goal of an endurance workout is to<br>
                increase the number of times your muscles can contract before they become too tired.<br>
                The simplest way to imagine this is by looking at a runner. Their goal is to increase the distance and the intensity<br>
                with which they can run at one time. To do this, they must improve their cardiovascular fitness and enhance the<br>
                amount of exercise their muscles can handle before collapsing!<br>
                Weightlifters also need to think about endurance. For endurance weight lifters, their goal is to increase the number<br>
                of repetitions their muscles can take lifting a particular weight before they collapse.<br>
                Examples of endurance exercises include the following:<br>

                <li>Star jumps</li>

            <span class="h1">Strength workouts</span>
            <p>Strength workouts, alongside endurance workouts, are the most popular types of training, especially in the gym.<br>
                Strength exercises are movements designed to build muscle mass. This happens by working the muscle until it<br>
                'rips.' The ripped muscle then repairs itself and grows back larger and stronger than it was before.<br>
                Strength training isn't only limited to weight machines and dumbbells because you can build strength through<br>
                resistance bands and bodyweight exercises as well. Strength training isn't just for weightlifters either, because we<br>
                need muscles for athletics and simple everyday movements such as lifting shopping bags or cutting wood if you<br>
                live on a farm.</p>

            <span class="h1">Balance Workout</span>
            <p>Balance is essential for all able bodies, not just for athletes. Without adequate balance, we would struggle even to<br>
                stand up straight, let alone walk to the shops or start lifting weights!<br>
                Balance rarely gets its own focused workouts, but balance-focused exercises can help to improve your overall<br>
                health and fitness and contribute to broader fitness goals. A typical workout could target the lower body to improve<br>
                balance or the core for stability.<br></p>

            <span class="h1">Yoga</span>
          
            <p>Yoga classes are great for strengthening both your body and mind.<br>
                A basic yoga session will consist of an instructor going over various stretches<br>
                and poses with you while you focus on breath and mindfulness.<br>
                <img src="resources/yoga_class.png" style="float: right;" class="rounded mt-4" >
                At your first session, don’t be worried if you can’t stretch into every single
                pose. You’ll adapt over time and become more flexible.<br>
               
                You should start off with a basic yoga course. There are other variations<br>
                available, such as hot yoga, but these are much more intense.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Before going to your first yoga class, make sure you have the right gear.<br>
                You typically need to bring your own yoga mat, but most studios have<br>
                basic loaners available.<br>
                You’ll also want to make sure you’re dressed appropriately. A loose<br>
                shirt and some comfortable yoga pants will help you get into every<br>
                pose.<br>

                Yoga is great for people trying to get into a new fitness regimen. It comes<br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Improved muscle tone and strength</li>
                    <li>Boosted flexibility and mobility</li>

            <p>Most fitness classes focus on one main type of exercise like yoga or cycling,<br>
                but you can also take hybrid classes to keep things fresh.<br>
                Hybrid classes incorporate different elements of fitness to work out several<br>
                different areas of the body.<br>
               
              <strong>Spenga </strong> is one of the most popular hybrid workout regimens to appear<br>
                in recent years. This class is focused on enhancing your strength and<br>
                endurance through a combination of yoga, HIIT training, and spin.<br>

                </div>
                Hybrid classes vary wildly from one gym to the next. Make sure you look into<br>
                what each specific class has to offer before signing up, so you know what<br>
                you’re getting into.<br>
                Hybrid classes are great for anyone who thinks they may get bored of the<br>
                same routine day in and day out. You may not always feel like doing yoga or<br>
                riding on a bike. With these classes, you get a chance to taste a little bit of<br>
                everything.
